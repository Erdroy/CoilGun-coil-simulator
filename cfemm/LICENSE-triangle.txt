Created as part of the Archimedes project (tools for
parallel FEM).  Supported in part by NSF Grant
CMS-9318163 and an NSERC 1967 Scholarship.  There is
no warranty whatsoever.  Use at your own risk.

Triangle generates exact Delaunay triangulations,
constrained Delaunay triangulations, and quality
conforming Delaunay triangulations.  The latter can
be generated with no small angles, and are thus
suitable for finite element analysis. 

Information on the algorithms used by Triangle,
including complete references, can be found in the
comments at the beginning of the triangle.c source
file.  Another listing of these references, with
PostScript copies of some of the papers, is available
from the Web page

received.  Private, research, and institutional use
is free.  You may distribute modified versions of
this code UNDER THE CONDITION THAT THIS CODE AND ANY
MODIFICATIONS MADE TO IT IN THE SAME FILE REMAIN
UNDER COPYRIGHT OF THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR, BOTH SOURCE
AND OBJECT CODE ARE MADE FREELY AVAILABLE WITHOUT
CHARGE, AND CLEAR NOTICE IS GIVEN OF THE
MODIFICATIONS.  Distribution of this code as part of
a commercial system is permissible ONLY BY DIRECT
ARRANGEMENT WITH THE AUTHOR.  (If you are not
directly supplying this code to a customer, and you
are instead telling them how they can obtain it for
free, then you are not required to make any
arrangement with [JRS].)

If you use Triangle, and especially if you use it to
accomplish real work, I would like very much to hear
from you.  A short letter or email (to
jrs@cs.cmu.edu) describing how you use Triangle will
mean a lot to me.  The more people I know are using
this program, the more easily I can justify spending
time on improvements and on the three-dimensional
successor to Triangle, which in turn will benefit
you.  Also, I can put you on a list to receive email
whenever a new version of Triangle is available.

If you use a mesh generated by Triangle, please
include an acknowledgment as well.
