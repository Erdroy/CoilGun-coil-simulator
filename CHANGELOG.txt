## [1.9] - 2017-04-26

## Modified

- Meshing now supports options forcemaxmesh and dosmartmesh

## fixed
- mmake.m: corrected missing mfemmdeps package namespace on call
  to parse_pv_pairs.m
- fpproc.cpp: added missing return statement to ElmArea

## [1.8] - 2016-09-18

## Notes

Releases now contain compiled binary mexfunctions for matlab

## Modified
- plotfemmproblem.m: optionally add material labels (or not)
- fpproc: added ElmVolume method in C++ and also to fpproc.m class
- fpproc: added 2D shape centroid block integral option

## Fixed
- hsolver.cpp: fixed major bug in writing solution file where wrong   
  conversion factor was used to convert from internal units of mm to 
  problem units
- plotfemmproblem.m: now handle case where there is no MagDirFcn field 
  in BlockLabel (e.g. in thermal simulation)
- loadfemmsolution.m: fixed bug where block material numbers were not 
  converted to names for non magnetostatics problems
- hpproc: fixed annoying debug message about smoothing
- build system, allow smoother mfemm build with mingw-w64 compiler 
  suite on windows platform, and make some initial changes to allow
  cross-build for windows from Linux using MXE (M Cross Environment)

## [1.7] - 2016-22-06
## Modified
- plotfemmproblem.m: now add labels with units to plot axes

### Fixed
- missing dependancy rad2deg.m added (needed for
  problem2freecad)
- Fixed problem with determining compiler in older versions of
  Matlab
- Fixed mfemm/MMakefile_fmesher.m to use forward slashes for Windows
  compilation (caused some problems with certain windows paths)
- checkgeom_mfemm.m: fixed endless loop when there are no nodes
  in problem


## [1.6] - 2016-02-24
### Added
- segmentlength_mfemm.m: returns length of a segment
- translatenewelements_mfemm.m: translates the n most recently
  added elements
- splitsegment_mfemm: split a segment into smaller subsegments

### Modified
- plotfemmproblem.m: add options to find and mark geometry
  problems on the problem plot

### Fixed
- findsegment_mfemm.m: change to use actual distance to segment,
  not segment mid points
- keep .edge file of mesh if keeping the mesh after loading it
  is requested
- checkgeom_mfemm.m: no longer reports overlapping nodes twice
- loadfemmsolution.m: correct loading of magnet direction when
  it is a lua function string
- plotfemmproblem.m: correct drawing of magnet direction when
  it is a lua function string
- Fixed various calls to functions in mfemmdeps package
- Various improvements to help text etc.

## [1.5] - 2015-08-28
### Added
- CHANGELOG.TXT
- Test_fpproc.m, and reference.fem. A basic test script and
  reference case for fpproc
- test_release.sh: release test script

### Fixed
- Properly implemented line integral matlab interface
- Added missing return statement in heat flow interface
